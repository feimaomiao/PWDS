## What is PWDS ##
* PWDS is a local, light weight command line encrypted password storage system with different actions and preferences avaliable 
* The entire program started with a little summer project and I never thought it would develop into a large-scale project :smiling_imp:
* The whole program is built on python3

## How does it work ##
* PWDS creates a database and allows you to change different attributes of it.
* Regular backup will be done.
* Cleverly uses clear screen function so that your passwords will not be kept on the terminal screen
* Even if you mess up, there will be a backup to save your day! Import backups are now avaliable!

## Possible problems you may encounter ##  
### WrongPasswordError ###  
* As its name suggests, you probably entered the wrong password. 
* As for extra security, we do not allow 'try agains' ~~we are just being mean~~  
* The occurance of wrong password entering will not affect your database! However, we will record every single attempt to login if 'Log login' preference is set to true

## Exports ##
* Sounds strange but we do let you export your saved password and logs in both encrypted and non-encrypted form.  
Avaliable output format includes:  

.txt|.csv|.json| .db  
---- | ----| ---- | ----
Plain text file | Comma Seperated Values file | JavaScript Object Notation | SQL Database File
